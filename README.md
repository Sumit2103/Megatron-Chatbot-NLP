Overview
In Education Domain, we divide problem formulation in two categories; general issue and technical issue. 
•	The ratio of both issues may vary time to time, example; if some new batch is launched then the customer support will get more general issue as compared to technical issue. 
•	In other case; when some difficult topic is covered in the class, then technical issue will be more than the general issue.
