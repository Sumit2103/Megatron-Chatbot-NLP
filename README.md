Overview:

In Education Domain, we divide problem formulation in two categories; general issue and technical issue. 
•	The ratio of both issues may vary time to time, example; if some new batch is launched then the customer support will get more general issue as compared to technical issue. 
•	In other case; when some difficult topic is covered in the class, then technical issue will be more than the general issue.

General Issues:

1.	Batch related query
2.	Dashboard issue
3.	Payment problem
4.	Assignment submission
5.	Current topic discussed in a class
6.	Internship and Resume related query

Technical Issues:

1.	How to use postman
2.	Heroku Deployment issue
3.	Database problem; mongo DB, MySQL, etc.
4.	CNN related query; number of inputs, epoch size, batch size, etc.
5.	LSTM understanding
6.	Anaconda Installation
7.	Assignment Solving issues

•	Developing automate software requires to deal with raw data as well as many AI technologies will be included like NLP, OCR, NLU and using multiple models or combination of that may produce roadblocks in rapid development of automation software.
•	This entire software includes creation of user interface also which is fairly straight forward when using standard HTML in web pages. However, using AJAX may not be accessible for quite some time to come. This is because these applications are often inherently dynamic. Thus the use of any new AJAX-based development platform may produce significant inhibitors or roadblocks in rapid development of automation software. 

Feature Description:

This project aims to reduce repetitive task for customer care support and for sales and marketing through automation. The core requirements for customer support automation include:
•	Understand user query and give response to them based on the training of the model.
•	Identification of intent & slot based on user query
•	Automatic ticket generation and send it to respective person or team.
•	Automatic upload of a file or image based on the intent classified and fetch required data from that uploaded file using OCR & use language understanding to understand the content or text from that uploaded file.
•	Once conversation ends with user, it should ask user for feedback & if it’s not satisfied, ticket should be raised and send it to respective team or user.
•	Along with that, chat summarization or abstract or summary of chat should be created using NLP and that chat abstraction should be sent to respective team while raising tickets.
•	There should be admin panel where model can be retrained automatic and model performance can be visualized through admin panel.
This document covers the basic business understanding document or high level document only, and not detail level document. Following this there will be additional product requirements to deliver in next phase of deliverable. There will be separate document for more detail level or for technical level details.

Features of AI Based Automation for Customer Services:

AI doesn’t need to completely replace human’s customer services representatives but AI can work in tangent with human agents.
1.	24/7 Customer Support: Customer service chatbots and automated assistance by AI will help to provide 24/7 services. A knowledge base can store a warehouse of answers for different questions, without the need of available staff.
2.	Staff Cost Reduction: Training call center staff is costly. Bringing on new employees, especially during crunch time, can really affect the company.
3.	Reduction in Waiting: AI is capable of filling in the gaps when a customer needs assistance. In general, callers provide information like name, phone, address, reference numbers, and other important details. AI can collect this info automatically and employ predictive methods to properly direct the caller to their solution.
4.	AI based Ticket Processing: Having a person read every message/mail a company gets to try to figure out what the customer needs and how to deal with it can be a very time-consuming task. In this place AI can be used to speed up the process.
5.	Text Summarization: Abstractive text summarization methods employ more powerful natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret text and generate new summary text
6.	Document or Image Scan: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technique can be used to recognize or read text featured in image files.
7.	Context Recognition: Context-based NLP starts with how search engines try to identify contexts that may be used to match particular user requests.
8.	Offer real-time support (FAQs, help blogs, reports): After recognizing the context of user question, it can offer FAQs, help blogs, reports and etc. to the users.

Business need:

In every domain customer care support is too much hurdle for the representatives. They need to support to their customers for the same queries many times or repetitively. To solve these issues there is a need for some kind of automation to reduce these repetitive tasks for the support team so that automate software should able to answer those queries within seconds of time and can more focus to solve complex issues.
To meet the ever-increasing competition and demands, iNeuron endeavours to deliver an accessible automate software for customer support as well as in sales & market domain.
